This will use the AutoAI dataset (Tedeschi) and walk through a demonstration of the end to end functionality of the CP4D platform.

## Collect
Show the Collect (from flat files and also touch on a simple IDB/Darwin table to show pulling directly from a DB)

## Organize
Organize (catalog auto metadata discovery functionality)

## Analyze
Analyze (data refinery, dashboard, AutoAI and Jupyter Notebook)

## Infuse
Infuse (Watson ML and OpenScale) functionality of the platform (please see Neal Finkelsteinâ€™s demo from IBM). We need the artifacts to demo the end to end functionality.
