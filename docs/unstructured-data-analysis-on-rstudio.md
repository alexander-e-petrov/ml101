Leverage code from hackathon and implement it in R, where a couple of thousand abstracts can be pulled live from PubMed (using user provided keyword stuck into the R code provided to them) and then present dynamic LDA clustering visualization and within R plots show the word clouds for each cluster, cluster size distribution and perhaps Carrot2 clustering/visualization of same data (though thatâ€™s not part of CP4D)
